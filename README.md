# Installation and Usage Guide

This file provides step-by-step instructions on how to install the required dependencies and use the Python script in this project. It also mentions the option of using a Python virtual environment for an isolated environment.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (recommended version: Python 3.7 or higher)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setting up the Virtual Environment (Optional)
To keep your development environment isolated, it is recommended to create and activate a Python virtual environment. This is optional but suggested to avoid conflicts with other libraries and Python versions.

1. Open a terminal or command line in the project's root directory.
2. Execute the following command to create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

   This will create a new directory called `env` that will contain the virtual environment and automatically activate it.

   When the virtual environment is activated successfully, you will see `(env)` in the terminal prompt.

## Installing Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in the project's root directory in your terminal or command line.
2. Execute the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary libraries and dependencies to run the Python script.

## Using the Python Script

The `gptech.py` file contains the main code for this project. Follow these steps to execute it:

1. Make sure you are in the project's root directory in your terminal or command line.
2. Execute the following command to run the script:

   ```bash
   python gptech.py
   ```

   The script will start running and display the results in the terminal.

## Additional Information

If you want more details about the script's functionality or additional information, please refer to the attached `README-GPTECH.md` file in the project's root directory. It will provide a more detailed description of the script's functions and features.
