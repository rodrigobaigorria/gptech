# GPTech: Code and Text Generator

## Code Description

The code provided in the "gptech.py" file demonstrates how to use the GPT-Neo 2.7B model to generate code and text based on a given prompt. The code utilizes the Transformers library from Hugging Face to work with the language model and tokenizer.

## Model Size and Generation

The model used in this code is "EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B". This model is part of the GPT-Neo family developed by EleutherAI and has approximately 2.7 billion parameters. Model size refers to the number of parameters trained in the model. The more parameters a model has, the greater its ability to capture the complexity and subtlety of natural language, but it also requires more computational resources for execution.

To generate code/text, the code follows these steps:

1. Checks if the model and tokenizer have already been downloaded. If they are not available in the current directory, they are downloaded and saved in the "gptech_model" and "gptech_tokenizer" folders, respectively.
2. Loads the model and tokenizer from the saved or previously downloaded files.
3. Defines a prompt, which in this case is "create a base component in ReactJS with Formik for login".
4. Tokenizes the prompt using the tokenizer. Tokenization converts the text into a sequence of tokens that the model can understand and process.
5. Uses the model to generate text from the input tokens. A maximum length of 500 generated tokens is set, and probabilistic sampling (do_sample=True) is allowed with a temperature of 0.7. A lower temperature produces more deterministic output, while a higher temperature allows more variability in the generated output.
6. Decodes the generated token sequence into readable text using the tokenizer.
7. Prints the generated text to the console.

## Hardware Recommendations

The GPT-Neo 2.7B model is very large and requires significant computational resources for execution. Make sure you have sufficient RAM capacity and processing power on your system to work with this model. It is recommended to have at least 16 GB of RAM and a GPU with 16 GB of VRAM for optimal performance. If you don't have access to a GPU, you can run the code on the CPU, but the text generation time will be significantly longer.

Additionally, if you plan to run this code on a cloud server, make sure to select an instance with enough CPU and memory resources to handle the model's workload.

It is important to note that generating text with large language models like GPT-Neo 2.7B can take time and require a significant amount of computational resources. Make sure to assess your needs and resources before using this model in production.

## Generated Response

The response generated by the model based on the provided prompt is as follows:

```javascript
class Login extends Component {
   

 constructor(props){
        super(props)
        this.state = {
            username: '',
            password: ''
        }
    }
    handleSubmit(event){
        event.preventDefault()
        const { username } = this.state
        const { password } = this.state
        axios.post('/api/login', {
            username,
            password
        })
           .then(response => {
                this.setState({
                    username: response.data.username,
                    password: response.data.password
                })
            })
           .catch(error => {
                console.log(error)
            })
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <div className="login">
                <form>
```
